# MPU-6050-codes-for-ROV

The following repository contains codes for taking the data of the yaw,pitch and roll values from the MPU 6050 sensor. The data from the serial monitor is fetched into the python code- mpy_python.py using the pyserial module. 

The python code uses pygame to visualize the position of the ROV in the water according to the sensor values of yaw, pitch and roll respectively. The visualization is done using the pygame module where the sensor values are also displayed.
